# Vote.org - Voter Information Access & Privacy Tool

## Introduction
This project is created for the Stanford x MIT Social Good Hackathon, aiming to provide a novel solution for Vote.org, a nonprofit organization focused on using technology to simplify political engagement and increase voter turnout. The tool addresses the need for voters to have control over their Personally Identifiable Information (PII) within Vote.org's systems.

## Project Description
Our tool empowers voters to request viewing, updating, or deleting their PII, ensuring Vote.org's compliance with the latest privacy legislations. It verifies the identity of users through their email addresses before granting access to their PII. Furthermore, it notifies users after their requests have been processed. The solution is designed to be flexible, extendable, and maintainable.
