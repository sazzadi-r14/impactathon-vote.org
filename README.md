# Vote.org Access and Privacy Tool

## Introduction
Vote.org is dedicated to using technology to simplify political engagement, increase voter turnout, and strengthen American democracy. Our platform provides voters with tools for registration, understanding election laws, and participating in the electoral process. This repository houses our innovative Access and Privacy Tool, designed to give users control over their Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in compliance with privacy legislation.

## Project Description
Our hackathon project addresses the critical need for data privacy and user autonomy over personal information. We provide users with the capability to view, update, or delete their PII within Vote.org's systems. The solution incorporates verification checks to ensure the security of user data and notifies users upon the completion of their requests.
